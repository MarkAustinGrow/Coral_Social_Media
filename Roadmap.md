✅ Updated System Overview with Infrastructure Requirements
Below is a structured summary aligning your needs with system modules and design patterns used in Coral Protocol and LangChain-based agents.

1. 🧠 LLM Services Layer
Component	Plan
LLM Provider	OpenAI (default), Anthropic Opus 4 (for Blog and Blog-to-Tweet agents)
Prompt Management	Each agent needs a prompt_pipeline: defines tool order and retry logic
Custom Prompt Design	Should include: goal → retrieve tools → act → respond → store logs

✅ Next Step:

Create a prompt_templates/ folder and define .txt or .json per agent with few-shot examples.

2. 🤝 Agent Orchestration (Coral Protocol)
Component	Plan
Coordination	Coral Protocol + LangChain ReAct-style agents
Triggering	Time-based (every 30 min) via internal polling
Workflow Engine	Not needed
Priority Handling	Can be embedded via prompts & Coral thread metadata

✅ Next Step:

Add a scheduler/ module with CRON-style intervals.

Ensure each agent reads "last updated" timestamp from Supabase to avoid duplication.

3. 🎭 Configuration & Persona Management
Component	Plan
Persona Storage	Character_files table in Supabase (persona.json)
Shared Persona	All agents use the same one
Environment-specific	Pull X followers + persona on agent boot

✅ Next Step:

Add persona_loader.py utility that initializes agent identity + social graph context.

4. 🕒 Scheduling System
Component	Plan
Triggers	Every agent checks every 30 mins except the Tweet Scraper
Scraper Strategy	Uses X API usage data to control frequency
Conflict Avoidance	Not needed (low risk of race conditions)

✅ Next Step:

Build a supabase-watcher.py that logs table size + agent state for proactive triggers later.

5. 🔍 Monitoring & Observability
Component	Plan
Agent Logs	Logs stored per agent in Agent_Logs table
Critique Agent Metrics	Will measure writing quality and pass/fail count
Audit Trail	Store actions, timestamps, and confidence scores (optional)

✅ Next Step:

Create schema: agent_name, event_type, payload, timestamp in Supabase.

6. 🧰 Shared Services
Component	Plan
Central Rate Limiting	Only Tweet Scraper + X Reply use X API logic
Shared Memory	Supabase + Qdrant act as long- and short-term memory
Error Handling	Use LangChain tool wrappers + retry decorators

✅ Next Step:

Wrap X API tool with a rate_limiter() decorator that reads quota from a control table.

7. 🧑‍💼 Human-in-the-Loop Interfaces
Component	Plan
Admin Dashboard	X API Control + Post Web Interface via Supabase UI
Approval Systems	Blogs: auto-approved; Posts: manual or automatic modes
Audit & Review	Full traceability via logs

✅ Next Step:

Build a blog_status enum (draft, reviewed, published) and display it on the web dashboard.

8. 🔧 System Personalization Requirements
Component	Plan
Core Setup	Supabase tables, .env file, X accounts, persona.json, Qdrant configuration
Content Preferences	Blog post word count, content status workflow, tone and style preferences
Engagement Metrics	Topics relevant to brand/audience with appropriate engagement scores
Scheduling Parameters	Tweet posting schedule, optimal posting times, content generation frequency
API Rate Management	Scraping frequency, retry logic, maximum API calls per time period
Agent Customization	Prompt modifications, temperature settings, agent-specific instructions
Error Handling	Error preferences, notification channels, retry policies
Monitoring	System performance tracking, content analytics, KPIs and success metrics

✅ Next Step:

Create a setup wizard script that walks users through the initial configuration process.
Develop a central YAML/JSON configuration file for system behavior beyond API keys.
Design a structured template for persona.json with clear documentation.
Build a simple admin dashboard for monitoring and managing the system.
Write comprehensive documentation covering all personalization aspects.
